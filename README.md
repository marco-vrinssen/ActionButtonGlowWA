# WeakAura function for World of Warcraft

## Applies a dynamic action button glow effect based on an automatic spell localization and anchoring function.

### Guideline

1. **Create New Text WeakAura**
   - Open WeakAura and create a new text element.

2. **Name the WeakAura**
   - Name the WeakAura exactly like the spell you want to have the glow effect applied to on your action bars.

3. **Paste the Code**
   - Paste the provided code inside the position input field of the text element.

4. **Set Parent to Anchor**
   - Check the box "Set Parent to Anchor" to ensure the text element is anchored to the button.

5. **Define Triggers**
   - Define the triggers for when the glow effect should be applied.

6. **Set Conditions or Actions**
   - Go to the conditions or actions tab to specify when the glow should appear.
   - In conditions and actions, when showing or hiding a glow effect, choose "Parent" as the anchor element defined previously.
